Description: Provides the 'vcd2df' function, which loads a IEEE 1364-1995/2001 
    VCD (.vcd) file, specified as an parameter as a string containing exactly 
    a file path, and returns an R dataframe containing values over time.  
    A VCD file captures the register values at discrete timepoints from a 
    simulated trace of execution of a hard
    ware design in Verilog or VHDL.
    The returned dataframe contains a row for each register, by name, and a
    column for each time point, specified VCD-style using octothorpe-prefixed 
    multiples of the timescale. The only non-trivial implementation details are
    that (1) VCD 'x' and 'z' non-numerical values are encoded as negative
    values (as otherwise all bit values are positive) and (2) registers with
    repeated names in distinct modules are ignored, rather than duplicated, as
    we anticipate these registers to have the same values.
